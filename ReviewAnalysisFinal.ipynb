      "I am posting this review after using the device for almost  60 days and I would like to divide my review into pros and cons.Excellent  Design,Thin, Dashing look ;-), 2.Excellent camera.Dual cameras do the job well.8GB RAM with snapdragon 835 ensures that all apps work smoothly.Like the new camera interface.I use Go Launcher  for cool looks for Icon & Themes...!!\n",
      "I was initially sceptical of buying this product at 33k - is it really worth the price and is it really a flagship killer, 1) Display is only Full HD, 2) No end-end display - unlike Galaxy s8/LG G6, 3) No OIS for camera, 4) Dual camera implementation is under development - it is a hit or miss based on experience, 4) Battery life, But still went ahead and placed an order on Amazon Primesale with 4k worth of offers on exchange.After using it for 4 days, I feel the following, 1) Phone is blazingly fast.I get 28 hours on moderately high usage, 5) Camera is pretty good in outdoor and indoors as well.Portrait and Macro mode, Pro mode work well.\n",
      ", || Verdict || One Plus 5 is definitely one of the best phones out there in the market and whether you should choose to go with it depends on type of user you are.If you are a phone geek, like to play heavy games, love photography this one is for you, but if you are buying it just for photography save your 3k bucks and buy honor 8 pro with much mature, tried and tested dual camera setup.\n",
      ", - Camera is awesome, dual camera setup really works\"Awesome phone.5/5, Best processor in the market, More than sufficient ram, Build quality 4/5, Feels solid in hand.Bit slippery but better than many phones.\n",
      "), 1.Camera---->Dual camera.Clearer photos is the tagline for this phone.But the second zoom camera is bad.It produces noisy photos, cannot shoot well in lowlight, has a slower focus than the main cam.And the portrait Dslr-like mode is half-baked.The images have smoothening at the edges and the effect is quite visible.Not usable at all.And the camera also lacks OIS...so videos are very shaky and there is no auto focussing inAwesome phone with unique features.... Very fast functioning.Very fast dash charging... Battery is also\", Camera, battery, screen, feel of the phone, most important is the dash charge.But overall smooth experience.\n",
      "\"Great product.It feels great when you hold it.is my first non Sony phone since 2002, but am still impressed.Sound and display are good.Fastest electronic device I have ever operated on.They definitely need to improve on this on their next model without increasing the price, else they should stop calling themselves as flagship, No separate tempered glass required as the phone comes with default screen protector over the gorilla glass, which is sufficient.Perhaps a good back cover can be purchased especially to protect the area around the dual camera which protrudes little bit above.\n",

      ", 1+5 though comes with a LPDDR4X RAM, 6 GB RAM with 64 GB internal storage or 8 GB RAM with 128 GB,, *** Application handling is lightning fast in 1+5 even quicker than Samsung S8.This is one key area where you cn really feel a BEAST in your hand.Its damn snappy, faster than any otherCAMERA :, xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, 1+3T came with a snappy 16 MP,f/2.0 rear & Front camera with Optical & Electronic image stabilization & 2160p video, *** The dual camera design is an exact replica of iphone 7 plus however it lacks the benefits & sophistication of iphone algorithms & further lack of proper optical image stabilization mostly creates softer & less detailed images when compared to flagships like S8,iphone 7 plus, HTC U11 etc.USB connector & FINGERPRINT SENSOR:, xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, 1+5 Comes with a v 2.0 Type C reversible USB connector same as 1+3T,however the blue tooth version is advanced to 5 and quick charge technology version to 4 .\n",

      "I was initially sceptical of buying this product at 33k - is it really worth the price and is it really a flagship killer, 1) Display is only Full HD, 2) No end-end display - unlike Galaxy s8/LG G6, 3) No OIS for camera, 4) Dual camera implementation is under development - it is a hit or miss based on experience, 4) Battery life, But still went ahead and placed an order on Amazon Primesale with 4k worth of offers on exchange.After using it for 4 days, I feel the following, 1) Phone is blazingly fast.I get 28 hours on moderately high usage, 5) Camera is pretty good in outdoor and indoors as well.Portrait and Macro mode, Pro mode work well.\n",

It is blazing fast and will perform most of your work in blink of anBokeh effects are awesome and rear camera setup is almost as good as iphone 7 plus and the front one exceedsAlert slider is a must have feature and I truely love it.Camera is great but not the best, colors come cold in outdoor mode, bokeh blur sometimes miss the foreground object boundaries with a noticeable amount.In some reviews camera of honor 8 pro beats OP5 in every aspect of still photography.\n",

Very fast functioning.Very fast dash charging... Battery is also\", Camera, battery, screen, feel of the phone, most important is the dash charge.But overall smooth experience.\n"

      "It probably is the best phone I have used till now.Excellent Camera, Just a few suggestions:, \"1.Just like the pre-installed screen guard, OnePlus should give at least one basic back cover/case with the phone.\n",
      "Need to improve the screen guard if they are charging 990 rupees.\n",
      "Good phone, Camera thik hai Lekin price ke hisab se kuch khash nahi hai, Oneplus 5 mobile ke screen protector glass market me available hai, Lekin oneplus 5 mobile ke sath company se screen guard aata hai use market me available karaya jana chahiye screen protector glass se mobile me laga hua screen guard bahot achcha diya hai us me mobile ka look bahot achcha lagta hai.\n",
      "If you want a fast phone here is the one and only one with lightning fast processing speed.Camera performance is outstanding even that too in low light it will take beautiful images.It must be protected with some camera protector screen guard and not by tempered glass as using tempered glass will cause damage to the camera ring.Other wise phone isSomehow oneplus manage to deliver strong battery life despite having 3300 mah battery.\n",

Overall its the best Oneplus device that they everWow this is super awesome phone, everything bit of it works smoothly, 8GB propells the device and there is almost space for everything, kills iphone 7plus, flagship killer, yes it is, Fingerprint sensor is super fast, if oneplus comes up with the next version, probably user will only have to show their finger to unlock the phone.\n",

      ", 1+5 though comes with a LPDDR4X RAM, 6 GB RAM with 64 GB internal storage or 8 GB RAM with 128 GB,, *** Application handling is lightning fast in 1+5 even quicker than Samsung S8.This is one key area where you cn really feel a BEAST in your hand.Its damn snappy, faster than any otherCAMERA :, xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, 1+3T came with a snappy 16 MP,f/2.0 rear & Front camera with Optical & Electronic image stabilization & 2160p video, *** The dual camera design is an exact replica of iphone 7 plus however it lacks the benefits & sophistication of iphone algorithms & further lack of proper optical image stabilization mostly creates softer & less detailed images when compared to flagships like S8,iphone 7 plus, HTC U11 etc.USB connector & FINGERPRINT SENSOR:, xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx, 1+5 Comes with a v 2.0 Type C reversible USB connector same as 1+3T,however the blue tooth version is advanced to 5 and quick charge technology version to 4 .\n",
      "lagging, switching on in roughly 5-7 seconds, I mean I can start using the phone almost immediately u switched it on.The design is sooo so sexy....very sleek and very attractive.Metal unibody with a sleek design and an awesome display....where else can you get them in just 33 k, 4.Dual camera setup at rear works great in Portrait mode.For taking ordinary pictures other than the portrait mode, the rear IMX398 SONY sensor does an great job too.The front 16 MP camera is superb too.Produces great pictures and video recording is superb too.The Images produced in rear camera under Ambient light conditions only are slightly more saturated compared too Honor 8 Pro.awesome.good phone sleek powerful ROM fast processing speed continuous use of 4g gives one and a half day backup really very good.Top of that dash charging from 2% to 100% in 90 minutes\n",

      "I was initially sceptical of buying this product at 33k - is it really worth the price and is it really a flagship killer, 1) Display is only Full HD, 2) No end-end display - unlike Galaxy s8/LG G6, 3) No OIS for camera, 4) Dual camera implementation is under development - it is a hit or miss based on experience, 4) Battery life, But still went ahead and placed an order on Amazon Primesale with 4k worth of offers on exchange.After using it for 4 days, I feel the following, 1) Phone is blazingly fast.I get 28 hours on moderately high usage, 5) Camera is pretty good in outdoor and indoors as well.Portrait and Macro mode, Pro mode work well.\n",
      ", || Verdict || One Plus 5 is definitely one of the best phones out there in the market and whether you should choose to go with it depends on type of user you are.If you are a phone geek, like to play heavy games, love photography this one is for you, but if you are buying it just for photography save your 3k bucks and buy honor 8 pro with much mature, tried and tested dual camera setup.\n",

      "), 1.Camera---->Dual camera.Clearer photos is the tagline for this phone.But the second zoom camera is bad.It produces noisy photos, cannot shoot well in lowlight, has a slower focus than the main cam.And the portrait Dslr-like mode is half-baked.The images have smoothening at the edges and the effect is quite visible.Not usable at all.And the camera also lacks OIS...so videos are very shaky and there is no auto focussing inAwesome phone with unique features.... Very fast functioning.Very fast dash charging... Battery is also\", Camera, battery, screen, feel of the phone, most important is the dash charge.But overall smooth experience.\n",
      "\"Great product.It feels great when you hold it.is my first non Sony phone since 2002, but am still impressed.Sound and display are good.Fastest electronic device I have ever operated on.They definitely need to improve on this on their next model without increasing the price, else they should stop calling themselves as flagship, No separate tempered glass required as the phone comes with default screen protector over the gorilla glass, which is sufficient.Perhaps a good back cover can be purchased especially to protect the area around the dual camera which protrudes little bit above.\n",

Was skeptical about it for a while because of some of the negative reviews for the phone.. But, Im full and full satisfied with OnePlus 5 and its feel good to hold the Phone in your hand.. Its light weight and cool phone.. Performance is fantastic and super fast with the latest processor.. Battery life lasts 24 hours for me with GPS, 4G fully on, occasional hot spot activation and me being in sales make regular calls.. And the dash charger is lightning fast and charges the phone in one hour.. So, battery being 3300 mah is not at all a problem.. Camera picture quality is awesome and it takes photos instantly.. Im not a lover of gaming in phones but tried 8 ball pool, cricket and they ran smoothly without any issues.. Night mode, reading mode and gaming mode are super cool.. Oxygen OS is as smooth as it is.. So, overall, Im pretty much satisfied with my OnePlus 5 and I would recommend the phone for anyone looking for a high performance phone with minimal budget..\"Its\n",

      "phone is a real good buy especially if u want a decent camera which does perform well but not perfect especially in low light settings when compared to the rest.Though camera is not upto the expectation is definitely better then most of the cameras inFor all those complaining about the price, come on people this is a private company.. let em make some mulah off of their hard work.PPI you can not differentiate, my Nexus had 445 but still 1+5 looks stunning.You can not participate in photography competitions with this camera but decent enough to preserve those memories.Also with use phone hangs.Really disappointed.Dont know if the product in general is bad or my product isThe most attractive asset of this phone is the camera.....the camera gives dslr like experience......, Camera features-, Potrait mode-excellent feature because of its telephoto lens which gives a good blur effect of surroundings..... comparable to that of iphone 7 plus...., Lossless clarity at 2x zoom, Aperture size is f/1.7 which is lowest among all phones till date at this lower price....even iphone 7 and 7+ have f/1.8 aperture size...... So one plus 5 has better low light camera than i phone itself......that speaks volumes of what the camera can actually do, Note that judging a camera by pixel clarity is like judging a book by its cover what really matters is the sensor size and aperture size in which one plus 5 rules....., It uses the latest sony sensors that are available in market these days....., The camera itself costs a alot, Iso range- it goes upto 9600 iso which is better than some of the dslrs like (canon-1300d which has a iso range of only 6400 ) that are available in market these days, Slow motion photography- excellent option for uploading some crazy and sporty videos on social media....., Flash is excellent which has a very high range, Each photo provides histogram which gives the exposure level of each photo, Front camera-, The aperture size is f/2.0 which is better than most of the rear cameras produced these days...., Produces beautiful shots even at low light situations, Display flash is good enough to take a picture of u and ur friend in any dark situation, Processor-, Processor is the latest one snapdragon 835....which itself is very costly and effective, Ram-6gb gives no lags even if u install and run a bunch of applications at a time, Oxygen os gives special features for personalization, Speaker-speaker sound is very loud and audible unlike most of the smartphones, Sensors- all of them are of great use, Fingerprint sensor is awesome which unlocks the phone before u know it, Phone is very slim which gives the premium feeling on holding it.....though it mentions 7.3 mm it feels much slimmer when u hold it because of its unique design....this u will experience only when u hold the mobile, Charging- dash charger is very effective it charges 70 percent of mobile in just 30 mins which is sufficient for the entire day upon optimal usage....., Aluminum metal body gives u a rich feeling when u hold it, Alert slider is awesome....u get the feeling of iphone with this button, Cons-, Use it carefully, It wont last long if u frequently drop it unlike samsung and sony mobiles, The front body seems to be weak so handle carefully, This is not water resistant so u cant use it under water, Front flash is not available so.....group selfies are not possible under low light condition...., Conclusion-, It is the cheapest mobile when we consider the specification in the high end phones, At this low price the phone is far exceeeding the expectation, Features are comparable and some are better than the costly iphone 7 plus and samsung s8 plus\n",

Was skeptical about it for a while because of some of the negative reviews for the phone.. But, Im full and full satisfied with OnePlus 5 and its feel good to hold the Phone in your hand.. Its light weight and cool phone.. Performance is fantastic and super fast with the latest processor.. Battery life lasts 24 hours for me with GPS, 4G fully on, occasional hot spot activation and me being in sales make regular calls.. And the dash charger is lightning fast and charges the phone in one hour.. So, battery being 3300 mah is not at all a problem.. Camera picture quality is awesome and it takes photos instantly.. Im not a lover of gaming in phones but tried 8 ball pool, cricket and they ran smoothly without any issues.. Night mode, reading mode and gaming mode are super cool.. Oxygen OS is as smooth as it is.. So, overall, Im pretty much satisfied with my OnePlus 5 and I would recommend the phone for anyone looking for a high performance phone with minimal budget..\"Its\n",
      ", The are that might disappoint you is its camera.Dash charge is one heck of a feature its chargers the phone so quickly you wont understand whats going on.Battery life is really decent you, if you are not using your phone much(just messaging and calling, online chatting) it would work for over 20 hours.\n",

      "the best phone I am using after such a long time I have used Samsung from past 5 years but let me very clear this phone is something and about battery life I am a heavy user of phone but still it gives a whole day battery unlike Samsung A7 or A9 ,there are so many plus points camera, personalisation can be done as per ur convenience, look,styling has a premuim feeling dont go by the words what other people say I have used premium phones but this phone is actually a performance based phone u can use it how u like ur ideal phone to be ,great features and a value for money it is a waste buying expensive phones which becomes obsolete after 6months but trust me guys this phone wont depress you awesome phone in budget only one thing is missing thats dust proof or water proof Its really a flag ship killer I phone is just popular as its has become style statement but needs charging 3 times a day no dash charge ,Samsung gives you a good day usage but lags a lot while operating  but one plus I all about performance .it will give you pleasure while using the phone very soon it will beat all other smart phone and reach the top in the competition very soonNot like other brand phones where you can see more of plastics.far so good.at this price,you will get nothing better than this.the 835 chipset is hardly present in any other phone in this price range.and the camera is not in the league of Iphone7 or S8 or HTCs U11 but is one of the best cameras in this price range and almost as good as the S8 and the i7 and the U11.\"\n",

It is a 33k phone and competition is tough this time with nokia 8 around with its OZO sound.I personally miss stereo sound on my phone.Also somehow the performance seems to drop day by day and the apps keep crashing in this device which is unacceptable for a device who tops the spec chart.The apps no longer remain in recent app screen and are refreshed 6 gigs of ram and 3 or 4 apps cant be kept without losing your work?There is definitely some issue with oxygen os, maybe upcoming updates will address these issues.One flaw I noticed with rear camera though is in portrait mode the pics are much grainier and dull.Mobile is great but definitely not because of its camera as its advertised so well everywhere.After using OP3, Im feeling kind of CHEATED.Learn to live with shaky videos now on-wards until you buy new phone with OIS in\n",
